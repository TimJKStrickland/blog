## Udacity Android Nanodegree

I've been fighting the Samsung for far too long, dammit. As of last week, I have jumped into the [Android Beginner Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803), and I'll go ahead and say it. Android is pretty dang cool. Writing Java and XML turns is a breeze, or at least writing hello world apps. Part of the reason that I wanted to hack on this ND is to play with the ASUS Zenwatch that came with the offer of being a pioneer of the ABND program.
