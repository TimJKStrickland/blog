title: October Monthly recap
---

I took September off from pretty much everything in search of a new job hunt. I realized that if I don't invest heavily in myself or my future well-being, that part of my life will stagnate and die, so it's best to keep moving in an onward direction. I did just receive some great news from a recruiter that I've been working with, so I'll be embarking on a new project with a _very_ cool company shortly. It turns out that I'm not too junior after all!

I've been building some react components but nothing too fancy. I'm still stuck in the "Framework" wars way of thinking about React and Angular2. It's not like it's difficult to get into either, but if you try to tackle both at once, I have found it far more difficult to get any sort of results out of it. Besides, the way it's looking, I'll need to tackle React first anyway. I've been using Safari Books Online because they're a great resource. The subscription can seem a little steep, but when you compare it to a gym membership (which if you think about it, it can be because you're training your mind), It evens out. It also depends on how much you want to put into your craft. I understand that drive to be thrifty, and I'll always lean on YouTube for tutorials as well. There's no reason why anyone should be stymied to learn code based on monetary troubles.

### Game Development

I had gone to Portland to vacation with a few of my friends in September, and I remembered how much I actually like playing video games. It's a weird thing to go from not wanting to play at all to trying to build your own but ever since that trip, I've wanted to focus on my game design and idea after I find a more steady developer job. I'm looking at using Unity to create the engine of the game, and Blender to build the assets. Should be fun, I think! Or rather, I hope. Anything that can mean fewer tired nights trying to hammer home some sort of new bit of code.

### Health and wellness

I've definitely fluctuated in my health a bit these last two months, BUT I am getting back into fermentation. I'm nervous about the sauerkraut I was making, but I think it will be edible. I *know* the kombucha will be edible. As far as the gym goes, I have been inconsistent at best. Twice in the last week with several weeks off in September. With the rain coming, I'm nervous about where exactly I'm going to train, and I might just cancel the membership to save on costs before Germany. I know I have some time but I really need to make sure to prep for that. 

Everything is getting better all the time, friends. Updates to come soon: What a first development job is like, Preparing for a trip to Germany, having a healthy romantic relationship with a mustache, being an adult who plays video games, and writing in NaNoWriMo.
