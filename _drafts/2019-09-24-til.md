excerpt: 'Pseudo elements valid and invalid'

Forms. We all love 'em. We all hate 'em. They're too long. They're too short. And it's hard to consistently to get a feedback on validating them without javascript.

_or so I had thought..._

# BEHOLD THE `input:valid and input:invalid`

This handy pseudo element is covered in all sorts of browsers, but keep in mind that this is **NOT** covered in [Edge or latest IE]() for form elements, so it's not recommended for production environments. Outside of form elements though it's all sorts of green. And hey! It's pretty slick, even for the simplest use case where 
```
<style>
  input:valid {
    color: green;
  }
  input:invalid {
    color: green;
  }
</style>
<label for="pizza-topping"></label>
<input id="pizza-topping" name="pizza-topping" placeholder="What's the best thing on pizza?" type='text' pattern='([A-Z])\w+'>
```
<style>
  input:valid {
    color: green;
  }
  input:invalid {
    color: red;
  }
  input {
    height: 40px;
    width: 100%;
    border: 1px solid;
  }
</style>
<form>
  <label for="pizza-topping"></label>
  <input id="pizza-topping" name="pizza-topping" placeholder="What's the best thing on pizza?" type='text' pattern="([A-Z])\w+" required="true" />
</form>

Here the only valid response is a string that is Sentence case at least. Again, because it's only experimental at this point, I don't really think this will make it to production anywhere. But still! Neat things are neat.
