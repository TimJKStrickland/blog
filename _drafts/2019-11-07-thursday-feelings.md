excerpt: What happens when you feel like you can do better

>> This is really bad.

You know that feeling. That feeling when someone reads code that you wrote months ago. That feeling when you know they looked at an incomplete solution, and even that solution was causing more problems than solving them. It's worse than a sinking feeling, but that's the closest I can describe it. That feeling that you may have screwed up really badly, and it could have affected the effectiveness of your overall project. It's doesn't happen every day, but often enough that each time it does you wonder whether you're actually cut out for this software engineering business.

_In short, you feel shitty._
