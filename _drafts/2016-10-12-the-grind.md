title: Will I ever get there?
excerpts: and other frustrations
---

Every day I try to code a little bit, and every day I hit a new hurdle. It's not that I think that I'm not skilled enough at anything to become a programmer, it's that even if I do focus, I still haven't built enough to prove my worth. What's worse is that I can't build for clients because there's not enough to show that I can build things without all of the things breaking.

## The Grind

The struggle is real in the Bay Area, friends. Either you hack at shit every day for 12+ months to find some entry level role or you keep digging yourself into more and more debt until you cradle yourself to sleep in a cocoon of sour patch kids and self-medication. I keep asking myself, do I even like web development? Am I learning anything?
