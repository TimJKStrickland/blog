## Lazy weekend

Didn't do squat, but it felt good because I've been burning it at both ends for a few weeks. I'll likely go back at it after I come back from Del Valle.

## Speed Run!

I've kept the [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.com) certificates on the back burner while I've been looking for a job, but now I can't stand not having finished either. I feel like Ben Affleck's character in The Accountant.

## Giffin' plans

I'm also working on a few different things. I want to start making a SPA of a gif maker because of a few things:

1. I'm tired of Gif Keyboard not being as reliable as it once was, and
2. gif's make me happy.


## Duolingo GOLD!

Yo logré todo de oro en Duolingo para Español! Me siento muy orgulloso pero yo sé que yo necesito practicar mucho más antes de yo puedo hablar que yo estoy bilinguë. Pero todavía!
