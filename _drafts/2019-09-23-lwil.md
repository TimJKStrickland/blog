## Free Code Camp Speed runs
Speed runs are an excellent way to get a lot of projects underway in a very short amount of time. They come in a lot of different flavors too. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/challenges) uses a great clean method of having a monthly theme with a weekly challenge issued every Monday. [Florin Pop recently threw down a helluva gauntlet with his #100Day100Projects](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/) which honestly, just sounds crazy... Is it even __possible__ to pull something like that off realistically? I find myself struggling to even complete _one_ of the CodePen challenges, and that's a contained challenge with very strict limitations on each prompt. To get started in some method, I decided to shotgun all of the projects for the Free Code Camp curriculum, and I realized something at the less than halfway point

### Each of these challenges are really just a method to test how well you plan _BEFORE_ you start writing the code

>No really. Why didn't I think of that?

Roy Carlson once said, "The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take." This rings so true with this current project that I'm instituting a new rule with following projects.

**MUST INCLUDE SKETCH BEFORE CODE**

Whether it's business logic, UI, UX, or all of it, it has to be written down somewhere first. Otherwise, I will go nuts. Again.

#### I'm also really slacking on the documentation of each of the projects which is...not great ðŸ˜¬

but in good news...
## I got married!
We did it, finally. It was a beautiful Thursday in one of my favorite places with my lovely then-fiancÃ© now wife, and everything was great.
