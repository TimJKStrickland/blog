The adage is that a writer should stick to what he knows, but when you're writing code, that adage doesn't hold much weight. The way JavaScript is written tends to make it modular which means that there's always more to learn in terms of frameworks or other parts that need deep dives (I'm looking at you, promises).

The problem becomes when I still don't quite understand all of what anything the Javascript books are telling me.
