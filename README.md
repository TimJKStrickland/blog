### Built with [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/www.jekyllnow.com)

From Barry Clark's ReadME:

```
**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.
```
