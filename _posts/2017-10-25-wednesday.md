#### *6:24PM*
Day 5. Sold the amp. Today I pushed the first Java code ever for a backend which was super cool for me. Java for some reason has always been super intimidating for me, so to have it done is uber uplifting.

## Plans

Tomorrow I'm shooting photo / video which is exciting. I have been slacking on my portfolio build, but I think this weekend I might make a trade that will excite my interest again in shooting a whole bunch. More details on that later.
