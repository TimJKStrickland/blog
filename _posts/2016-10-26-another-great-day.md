title: Another Great Day
excerpt: Because no one is meant to sleep 4 hours at a time.

I slept for almost nine hours. I didn't look at social media or check my email. I was outside my conscious from a blissful 9:30pm to an alert 6:30am the next day. And I have to admit something: I have never liked sleep, and I still don't. But I definitely appreciate it more as I'm growing older

I don't think it's ever healthy to try and do too much. There are reasons to push yourself and yes, it can benefit you especially in this hurry-up-and-wait culture of getting the next big whether it be a promotion, the new title, or just a new camera (in my case it's usually a new camera). And sometimes that calls for sacrifice. But is it ever worth it? How many times ihave you stayed up until 2 in the morning on Facebook, Netflix, or any certain project that **HAD TO BE DONE** by morning and felt great at 9am? Never, because it doesn't happen. With the States creating a new workweek based on the successful elite touting how much they get done on a 100 hour a week work schedule, it's crazy to imagine now anyone without a side hustle. In my corner of the world, it's generally accepted for people to work from 9 to 9 if only because the company provides lunch and dinner. They don't want you to leave because deadlines. And while for their bottom line, those companies are reaping the benefits their workers are grinding for a purpose that may or may not return rewards.
