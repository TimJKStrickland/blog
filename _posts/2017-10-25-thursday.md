Day 6. Big day today: Work, event, papercrafting. Hopefully it turns out ok with posterboard!

I need to get workin' on my [FCC](freecodecamp.org) projects. This week has been tough to squeeze out extra hours here and there.

Just bought my plan tickets yesterday for my second trip outside the US this year. I can't believe what a year 2017 has been for me personally. Globally, there are a few issues that maybe scare me, but my career and life aspirations have shifted into second gear. I'm becoming the person I thought I was at 25.
