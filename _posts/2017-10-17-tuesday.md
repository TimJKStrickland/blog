### *6:44AM*
Day 4 of writing every day. Woke up early enough to Lyft, but I'm still not sure it's worth it. The rates look good though.

I worked on some animations yesterday that were pretty cool. Turns out having a border meet in the middle is actually a little more complicated than I had anticipated. An absolutely positioned span helped to finish the top part. I'll port it over in a little while to make an example.

## Tribute page

The user story is fairly straightforward for this project, so it took me very little time to actually complete and more time to set up (and then abandon) Sass in Create React App. I love that it gives you a fully functional React project, but as soon as I need to dismantle it, I start running into compile issues. I'm still looking into a more permanent fix since I like writing in Sass over strict CSS. More on that later too.

### Portfolio page

I always thought this project was a little premature in the FCC rubric. There's not a lot to show quite yet, so it'll be mostly placeholders.
