## MongoDB 101

In February I took on the learning program outlined by user @P1xt. I went through the edX MongoDB course which was pretty good. The feeling leaving the lesson was that I could possibly build it on my own, which is good. They didn't spoonfeed you code, but they gave real examples of use cases for when you would use the parts of a MEAN stack to build such an app.

## Germany Trip

An incredible trip with my younger yielded a huge satisfaction for my life and my mind. I looked at code a few times, but it was worth the break, even while I was battling an illness. Special thanks to Julian and Nicole Gleitsman for not only showing us around but also letting us rest our weary heads on their couches.

## Free Code Camp Cohort!

My first Free Code Camp cohort began! It's been an amazing already, and it's difficult to believe that it's almost over.
