### *3:48PM*
Day 6 of writing every day. I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something...I hate this feeling. Must be too little beneficial sleep. Wasn't able to sell off my guitars yesterday which bummed me out for muliple reasons.

### Intermediate Projects

Starting on the intermediate projects this weekend once I get the routers figured out. I'm looking at a [couple]() of [walkthroughs]() [egghead.io](). It requires some restructuring of the app basics and I've just been gassed once I get home, so it's difficult to actually put forth a whole lot of thought and motivation into doing anything with them.
