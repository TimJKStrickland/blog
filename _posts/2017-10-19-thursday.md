### *3:48PM*
Day 6 of writing every day. I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something...I hate this feeling. Must be too little beneficial sleep. Wasn't able to sell off my guitars yesterday which bummed me out for muliple reasons.

### Intermediate Projects

Starting on the intermediate projects this weekend once I get the routers figured out. I'm looking at a [couple](https://medium.com/@pshrmn/a-simple-react-router-v4-tutorial-7f23ff27adf) of [walkthroughs](https://medium.com/lexical-labs-engineering/redux-best-practices-64d59775802e) [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-style-a-link-that-is-active-with-navlink-in-react-router-v4). It requires some restructuring of the app basics and I've just been gassed once I get home, so it's difficult to actually put forth a whole lot of thought and motivation into doing anything with them.
