title: Engineering Emotionally
excerpt: What happens when you feel like you can do better

> This is really bad.

You know that feeling. That feeling when someone reads code that you wrote months ago. That feeling when you know they looked at an incomplete solution, and even that solution was causing more problems than solving them. It's worse than a sinking feeling, but that's the closest I can describe it. That feeling that you may have screwed up really badly, and it could have affected the effectiveness of your overall project. It's doesn't happen every day, but often enough that each time it does you wonder whether you're actually cut out for this software engineering business.

_In short, you feel shitty._

This is typically when I go back through old mentors and hero worship the bejesus out of people who maybe have gone through the same thing. I always start with [the Jeff Atwood article](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/) where I heard it best:

> The Best Code is No Code At All

And with that, I feel set free almost. It's not about how much code I write, or if I can find the perfect algo or how much I google. The whole point of being a software engineer is to debug my own brain, little by little. It's challenging. It's heart-breaking and uplifting. Trying to write any code, even if it's no code feels like a small telenovela playing in my brain to try and be the most logical smallest if statement I can type.

```
  if(small){
    makeSmaller();
  }
```
Software engineering almost feels therapeutic in that sense. It's hard work, it's soul-searching at times, but in the end, you hopefully made a thing that helps you find a place in the world wide.
