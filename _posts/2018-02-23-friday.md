## Expanding the language base

I've been doing my best to learn as much Javascript as I can in a short amount of time, and now there is a need to learn other languages. I started with a little Java which was nice because I could apply it directly, but now I'm switching gears into RUBY!

### but it's not Tuesday?

I'm really excited to get under the hood of how Ruby works not solely because it will serve me later. I really would like to understand the Jekyll build process too, and why they went with Ruby. Having used Jekyll on multiple sites at this point, it seems like a good time to dig a little deeper into how it all works.
