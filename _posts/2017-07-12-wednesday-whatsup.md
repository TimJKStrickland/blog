## Meetup at Firefox

My friend [Hunter Lester Benevedes](https://twitter.com/GuilfordHunter) hosted his first meetup about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and it went really well!

Some of it was over my head since I've only done a few tutorials with Rust but the core concepts seemed like a good fit for his project on Raspberry Pi Zero's specs and Rust. Considering I have a [Maker's Kit from Particle](https://store.particle.io/products/particle-maker-kit) that I haven't used in a while, it was good to get back in touch with the world IoT. I found a [repo](https://github.com/zsup/firmware-rust/) of contributors that seems like a good place to start on that. Exciting stuff to come!

## Duolingo Gold

Yo he practicado mucho en [Duolingo](duolingo.com), y ahora yo quiero tener todo oro! It'll take some time, but I did it once before. This <50% fluent in Spanish is killing me because I know I'm at least 51% fluent.

It brings up a good point about Duolingo's percentages. How arbitrary is this ruling? It's already difficult enough to measure how fluent I am in Spanish even though I use it daily to communicate via [Speaky](https://www.speaky.com) and my SO, but will I ever get to 100%? Is Duolingo even trying to get people to be at 100% fluent by their standards? And what does that even mean?

## Applying for LATAM

It does give me a more confidence to go after roles in Latin America and jobs where being bilingual might be an asset. In an ever-increasing remote world, having one more skill to help build bridges can only help my career. More exciting developments to come, me imagino!

### Recommendations

I've been listening to a lot of [Ryan Waggoner](http://ryanwaggoner.com/) which I like as his webinars impart plentiful information on what it takes to freelance and how to get going on your freelance career. He's done several webinars and provided links to his presentation, notes, and other relevant links. Another huge takeaway is his advice to just get started. You are going to screw up, so you might as well do it, and then learn from it. It echoes a [TJ Miller podcast on Nerdist](http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-t-j-miller-3/) that I also recommend about how to be kinder to others by being kinder to yourself.

Go look at [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and break something.
