## Udacity Android Nanodegree

I've been fighting the Samsung for far too long, dammit. As of last week, I have jumped into the [Android Beginner Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803), and I'll go ahead and say it. Android is pretty dang cool. Writing Java and XML turns is a breeze, or at least writing hello world apps. Part of the reason that I wanted to hack on this ND is to play with the ASUS Zenwatch that came with the offer of being a pioneer of the ABND program. 

### Does anyone really know what time it is?

The idea of online education is great. For those that are too busy, or have other responsibilities are given the freedom outside of a classroom setting to really hone their own skills. So why does it suck so much to drag yourself to do something you actually want to do? Actually studying is a *chore* that never ever ends.
