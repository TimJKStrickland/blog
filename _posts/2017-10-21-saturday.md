### Intermediate Projects: Quote Machine

Building in React versus using jQuery has made me start thinking about the app's architecture more which is cool. I haven't dealt with much of in my career yet, so it's fascinating to start looking at the separation of concerns this early. I followed [this video walkthrough](https://x-team.com/blog/react-redux-api-axios/) which has been super helpful so far. I didn't realize that Redux would be necessary this early, but it does make logical sense to start separating this out now, so I have fewer bugs once I get into the backend projects. I'm excited to finish this one off quickly so I can get going on the others and really get this architecture flushed out. I've also been following the [React Router course on Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-run-the-react-router-v4-examples-with-create-react-app), which has also been super helpful.
