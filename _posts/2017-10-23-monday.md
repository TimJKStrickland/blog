#### *9:40AM*
Day 3. Busy-ish day today. I'm hoping to get through many things in my to do list, including the making of my Halloween mask. I'm doing a papercraft style mask for a masquerade this weekend. 

Listened to the [Syntax](https://overcast.fm/+JaI4fpqSU) where they talk about build systems and roles put into apps. A pretty interesting discussion of things I haven't really touched. I was super intrigued as to how to set up those role systems, so I can't wait for them to come out with that next episode.

Yesterday I was unwinding with one of my favorite Youtube shows [Hot Ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl-X3dhooPM). I recommend it to any hustler that's trying to do some good hustle. He talks about winning in a way that was (for me at least) approachable. It's a hard concept for me because I'm not exactly driven by competition.
