title: June 2017 update
excerpt: Excellence is a habit

Well June came and went. My first few months at Vionic has proven to be quite a ride. I've built a out a Wordpress child theme from scratch for the new [blog](vionicshoes.com/blog), and that's just the tip of the iceberg! I'm also starting to get into my freelance work!

## Work-work-work

What's liberating about having finally been hired is also the same thing as what's terrifying. I'm living what I had been dreaming for so long that I thought I could finally relax a bit which for the most part is true. The flip side of it turns out to be that I can only relax so long as I'm still learning. I'm realizing that it could be very easy to fall into a trap of working the 9 to 6 and feeling like that's enough for now. That's fine for some, but I feel like I just did that and forgot where four years of my life went.

So now my new goal is to start getting new clients. People who need JavaScript and PHP help and to keep focusing on site speed and latency. I'm still very interested in how the [DOM](http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_dom.html) is processed, so I've started to look again at the [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com) tutorials as well the [Front End Handbook](https://www.frontendhandbook.com/). Both seem like the good resources I need to propel me forward.

### How many clients, Tim JK?

I recently heard a [webinar from Ryan Waggoner](http://ryanwaggoner.com/) who has gone through what I feel could be my future 10 years in this career. The webinar was incredibly insightful and a couple of his suggestions really resonated with me:
1. **Don't charge hourly. Get a contract for a flat rate and a percentage up front**
I really like this idea because keeping track of an hourly schedule is one more hassle on an itemized receipt that I don't want to show my clients. It makes way more sense to me and looks more professional to introduce a flat rate at the beginning with a percentage being paid out on delivery. This gives clear expectations on both sides. I don't feel pressured to rush my work, and clients don't get a mystery bill.
2. **You are going to make mistakes and that's ok**
A big worry for me is making sure that I come across as the best candidate for the job, and part of that can lend itself to a rabbit hole of perfectionism. Like TJ Miller said on the Nerdist, [we need to be kinder to ourselves](http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-t-j-miller-3/). The internet is a big, scary, fast place where devs can get gobbled up by the latest framework and feel like nothing will ever get done.

Take your time. Do good work. Always improve. And then flow will find you.


### Parting shots

I'm still mid-process on the [Free Code Camp certificates](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/claim-your-front-end-development-certificate) which have sat on the back burner for too long now. I'm aiming to finish those by end of July if not earlier. I'm also working on a website revamp to gear up for more freelance work which is super exciting for me. Lastly, I'm learning more about [Spiritapp.io](https://spiritapp.io/), a new animation that's looking pretty slick. What are you working on? Hit me up.
