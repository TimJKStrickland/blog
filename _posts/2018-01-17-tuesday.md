## Back in the States

After a very lovely break in Chile, I've been steadily working through the React lessons that [Wes Bos has put together](https://reactforbeginners.com). It's been very helpful in getting a leg up on the library. For me, the tutorial on their [main page](https://reactjs.org/) was helpful but it only goes so far as to explain how to operate within components. So far I've gotten a better handle on component building, and I'm looking to implement a free code camp repo of all the projects housed in one standalone app. It's pretty exciting!
