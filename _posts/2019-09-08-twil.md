## Selling motorcycles
I sold a motorcycle today! A vet came by looking for my &lsquo;96 Honda Shadow, took it for a test drive, and rode it into the sunset. Big thanks to Ernesto for helping me get rid of one more toy that I don&rsquo;t need!

## React-Rails builds
This was a fun week of building out the [heroku guide](https://blog.heroku.com/a-rock-solid-modern-web-stack) for a Rails, React, Active Admin production ready site. It worked for the most part without any real problems, though there were a few changes done to how heroku deploys a rails app that kept tripping me up.
