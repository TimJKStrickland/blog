excerpt: First placement, Cohorts, and Chingu in general

April has been insane. I was contacted by a company called Vionic Group and I'm now doing development work for them out of San Rafael. It's been an incredible few weeks.

## It can happen to anyone

I had been looking actively for about 6-8 months and passively for about a year and a half, and I finally found a place to call 127.0.0.1. There were definite moments of doubt, imposter syndrome and close interviews, but the thing that kept me coming was back the consistency of the code. Whether or not I understood the take home code project or not, in most cases I learned to adapt. There was one take home exam that gave me particular trouble. PostgreSQL is nothing to sniff at, but I'm hoping to eventually conquer that one this month.

### May landmark goals

1. Complete the Front End Certificate for FCC
2. Complete the Back End Certificate for BCC
3. Redesign my portfolio to accomodate those goals
4. Design a photog portfolio for wedding season

# Parting shots

I want to contribute more to Chingu Central but with the long commute, it's difficult for me to devote any real time to it. We'll see if that changes once I buy a car. Super stoked to learn more about Magento and keep hacking away at performance!
