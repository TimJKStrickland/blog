## New Gig!

The phone gods have been graceful this week, and I've got several things brewing. I can't talk about too many of them yet, but everything's coming up Milhouse.

## Angular lessons - Where else can you get?

[Egghead.io](https://egghead.io), [YouTube](youtube.com), [Udemy](https://udemy.com)...I'm trying to round out as much as I can of learning Angular as quickly as possible. I'll make another post about the basics of Angular this weekend, I think. Just so I have it in my own words with my own spin. It'll probably help my brain in the long run.

## My new cards came in!

I think they look sweet.

Eso es.


<!-- ## Lazy weekend

Didn't do squat, but it felt good because I've been burning it at both ends for a few weeks. I'll likely go back at it after I come back from Del Valle.

## Speed Run!

I've kept the [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.com) certificates on the back burner while I've been looking for a job, but now I can't stand not having finished either. I feel like Ben Affleck's character in The Accountant.

## Giffin' plans

I'm also working on a few different things. I want to start making a SPA of a gif maker because of a few things:

1. I'm tired of Gif Keyboard not being as reliable as it once was, and
2. gif's make me happy.

The project starts in the brainstorming area today.


## Duolingo GOLD!

Yo logré todo de oro en Duolingo para Español! Me siento muy orgulloso pero yo sé que yo necesito practicar mucho más antes de yo puedo hablar que yo estoy bilinguë. Pero todavía!
