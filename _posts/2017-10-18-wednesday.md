### *7:44AM*
Day 5 of writing every day. Feeling super tired today and lethargic. Excited to sell a whole bunch of stuff though.

### Portfolio page

I wasn't able to put in too much effort on the project yesterday due to poor time budgeting. It's a skill that constantly feels like I'm cutting with the ass end of the knife.
